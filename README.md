### Problem

In the U.S. around 40% of all food gets wasted, with nearly half (43%) of that waste happening at the hands of the consumer. There are many reasons why food gets wasted:

 - Forgotten or hidden food
 - Safety Concerns (based on labels or arbitrary dates)
 - Not home enough
 - Miscommunication about who gets the leftovers
 - Portion issues (over cook, over serve, not enough ingredients or food for a meal)
 - Experimental cooking (tastes bad)

<b>I aim to solve for well intentioned consumers who forget or can't see food and end up having to throw it out.</b>

### Proposal

DESIGN CHALLENGE
Improve discoverability of hidden or forgotten food in the fridge, even while the user is not at home.

SOLUTION
Create a smart tupperware device that monitors food freshness, sets smart timers based on the contents in the container and provides helpful, delightful and subtle reminders so you don't forget about the food that got pushed to the back of the fridge.

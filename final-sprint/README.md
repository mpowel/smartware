# Final Sprint

CLASS OBJECTIVE
At the beginning of this course, I said I was aiming to solve for well intentioned consumers who waste food on accident due to lack of visibility and forgetfulness.

DESIGN CHALLENGE
Improve discoverability of hidden or forgotten food in the fridge, even while the user is not at home.

SOLUTION
Create a smart tupperware device that monitors food freshness, sets smart timers based on the contents in the container and provides helpful, delightful and subtle reminders so you don't forget about the food that got pushed to the back of the fridge.

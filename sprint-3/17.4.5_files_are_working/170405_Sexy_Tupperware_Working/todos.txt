10:34 attached sensor (~150)    (fresh air)
10:35 added strawberry  (range 160 - 627)
11:54 removed strawberry   (max 627)
11:56 started control test   (~190)      (removed strawberry & washed tupperware)
1:43  opened lid
1:50  added fresh cut strawberry (not rotting)      (150 - 320)
3:15  opened lid   
3:16  moved to yogurt  (has been sitting out for 2 hours)  230 @ 95F - 216 @91
   -  also added plexiglass frame (need to test gas reading from frame only)
   -  canâ€™t seal it
3:53  moved to sealed container

OPTION 1: Preset counter for 7 days (uses temp sensor as trigger, fully automated)

1 A) Configure stages of light readings
  - Lights off: Waiting
  - Blinks twice: starts with push of button
  - Light countdown: Placed in fridge (timer auto starts when Temp < 30F)
  - Blinks yellow: Time passed set threshold
  - Auto turn off: Temp > 60F for > 4 hours
  - Light sensor triggers neopixel to dim and turn up
    (not turn off because that might destroy the neopixel counting)

NEXT STEPS:

1 B) Configure stages of light readings
  - Lights off: Waiting
  - Light countdown: Placed in fridge (timer auto starts when Temp < 30F)
  - Blinks yellow: Time passed set threshold
  - Auto turn off: Temp > 60F for > 4 hours
  - Light sensor triggers neopixel to dim and turn up
    (not turn off because that might destroy the neopixel counting)


OPTION 2: Custom counter for 5-10 days (triggers by "4095" in potentiometer)

Configure stages of light readings
  - Waiting
  - Blinks blue: Timer started (potentiometer goes to 10)
  - Light countdown: Timer set (you can see it start to move)
  - Blinks yellow: Time passed set threshold
  - Temperature sensor could be used to auto turn off (if warm for > 4 hours)
  - Light sensor triggers neopixel to dim and turn up
    (not turn off because that might destroy the neopixel counting)


DONE
Connect new particle to web
Filter out -196
Set up potentiometer
     Convert voltage change to days and mark potentiometer
     As percent of max min range?
